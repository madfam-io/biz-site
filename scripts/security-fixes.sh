## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please send an email to security@madfam.io

## Security Measures

### Dependencies
- Automated vulnerability scanning with \`audit-ci\`
- Monthly dependency updates
- Security-first dependency selection

### API Security
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- CORS configuration
- Security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)

### Data Protection
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Environment variable validation
- No secrets in code or logs
- GDPR-compliant data handling

## Security Checklist

- [ ] All API routes have rate limiting
- [ ] All user inputs are validated
- [ ] All secrets use environment variables
- [ ] All dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Security headers are configured
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive info
