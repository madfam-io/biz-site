2. **Full paths** of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
3. **Location** of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
4. **Special configuration** required to reproduce the issue
5. **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
6. **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
7. **Impact** of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours of receiving your report
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Status Updates**: Every 7 days until resolution

- **CORS Policy**: Strict cross-origin resource sharing configuration

### Infrastructure Security

- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All traffic encrypted with TLS 1.3
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security headers implemented
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP to prevent XSS attacks
- **Environment Isolation**: Clear separation between development, staging, and production
- **Dependency Management**: Regular security audits of dependencies
- **Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring and alerting

### Code Security

- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

- **Code Reviews**: Mandatory security-focused code reviews
- **Secrets Management**: No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions for all services

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update all dependencies
2. **Validate All Inputs**: Never trust user input

6. **Regular Security Testing**: Include security tests in your test suite

### For Deployments

1. **Use Secure Defaults**: All security features enabled by default
2. **Regular Security Audits**: Monthly security assessments
3. **Backup Security**: Encrypted backups with secure access
4. **Access Control**: Multi-factor authentication for all accounts
5. **Monitoring**: Continuous security monitoring and logging
6. **Incident Response**: Documented procedures for security incidents
