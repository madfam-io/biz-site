## Step 14: Test the Setup

1. Create a test branch: `test/quality-gates-setup`
2. Make a small change
3. Push the branch
4. Create a PR to `develop`
5. Verify:
   - ✅ CI workflow runs
   - ✅ All quality gates execute
   - ✅ Code owners are requested for review
   - ✅ Branch protection prevents merge until checks pass
6. Delete the test branch

## Step 15: Documentation

1. Update README.md with badges:

```markdown
# MADFAM Corporate Website

[![CI](https://github.com/madfam-io/biz-site/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/madfam-io/biz-site/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![CodeQL](https://github.com/madfam-io/biz-site/actions/workflows/codeql.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/madfam-io/biz-site/actions/workflows/codeql.yml)
[![Deployment](https://github.com/madfam-io/biz-site/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/madfam-io/biz-site/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)
```

2. Create or update CONTRIBUTING.md with:
   - Development workflow
   - PR process
   - Code review guidelines
   - Quality standards

## Troubleshooting

### Workflows Not Running

- Check GitHub Actions are enabled in Settings
- Verify workflow YAML syntax is valid
- Check workflow permissions

### Status Checks Not Required

- Ensure workflows have run at least once
- Status check names must match exactly
- Workflows must complete successfully

### Secrets Not Working

- Verify secret names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Check secret scopes (repository vs environment)
- Ensure secrets are not accidentally exposed in logs

## Maintenance

### Monthly Tasks

- Review Dependabot PRs
- Check security alerts
- Review failed workflow runs
- Update required status checks if workflows change

### Quarterly Tasks

- Review and update branch protection rules
- Audit team permissions
- Review quality gate metrics
- Update documentation
